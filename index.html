      Welcome to my portfolio webpage. My name is Alex and I'm located in the state of West Virginia (not the same as western Virginia!). I discovered Thinkful in 2023 and have since started on a journey to pursue a career in software engineering.

    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
      One of the reasons I left medical school to pursue a different career is because I believe that I will be able to learn and do my best work and in an environment that I have more control over. That is one of the reasons Thinkful's online curriculum appealed to me. Furthermore I believe that the following qualities will allow me to succeed in the Thinkful program:
      <ul>
        <li>Willingness to learn</li>
        <li>Cooperating and working with others</li>
        <li>Dedicating time to practicing fundamentals</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These are qualities that would allow success in most fields, but having practiced these in the medical field, I feel ready and excited to apply these to the Thinkful program and my future career.

    <h3>My Hobbies:</h3>
    <img src="images/gaming-game-dota2-gamer.jpg" width=250px alt="Dota 2">

    <p>One of my favorite pastimes is playing computer games with my friends. We all join a shared discord so we get to play games together even though we live states apart/far away from each other. Our favorite game is Dota 2.</p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="images/Tennis_racket.jpg" width=75px alt="Tennis Racquet">
    <p>I have been playing tennis since high school. It's harder to find people to play tennis with than dota 2 but it is a passion of mine. I also love to watch, talk about, and follow professional tennis (ATP/WTA). </p>
